[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgazebo_ros_diff_drive.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "gazebo_ros_diff_drive", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "gazebo_ros_diff_drive" with any of the following names:

    gazebo_ros_diff_driveConfig.cmake
    gazebo_ros_diff_drive-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gazebo_ros_diff_drive" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "gazebo_ros_diff_drive_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "gazebo_ros_diff_drive" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
